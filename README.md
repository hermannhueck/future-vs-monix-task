# Future vs. Monix Task

This repo contains code & slides for my talk on this topic.
<br/>
<br/>

scala.concurrent.Future is familiar to most Scala devs.

This presentation first talks about referential transparency and the IO Monad.

Then it compares Future with monix.eval.Task (Monix 3.x)
with their Pros and Cons.

As Scala's *Future* is used in many ennvironments and libraries, we look at
how *Future* can be converted to *Task* and - vice versa - how *Task* to *Future*.

Often recurring on the valuable Monix *Task* doumentation at<br/>
https://monix.io/docs/3x/eval/task.html<br/>
the presentation also gives an introduction to Monix Task.
