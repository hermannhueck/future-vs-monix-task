# Future vs. Monix Task

This repo contains code & slides for my talk on this topic.

scala.concurrent.Future is familiar to most Scala devs.

This presentation compares Future with monix.eval.Task (Monix 3.x)
with their Pros and Cons.

It gives an introduction to Monix Task and deals with the interop between the two.

Work in progress ...
